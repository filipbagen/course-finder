# Authentication and Token Refresh Implementation

## Overview of Changes

This implementation addresses authentication token management and refresh issues in the course-finder application. We've implemented robust token refresh mechanisms and improved error handling for better user experience.

## Key Components

1. **AuthDebug Component**

   - Added a debug component for development that shows authentication state
   - Helps with diagnosing authentication issues

2. **AuthProvider Improvements**

   - Enhanced token refresh logic with multiple retry attempts
   - Added better error handling for network issues
   - Implemented proactive token refreshing

3. **TokenManager Service**

   - Created a new utility to centrally manage token refreshing
   - Implements automatic refresh when tokens are close to expiry
   - Handles refresh throttling to prevent excessive API calls

4. **Supabase Client Enhancements**

   - Added retry logic for auth operations
   - Implemented timeouts to prevent hanging operations
   - Added better error handling and recovery mechanisms

5. **Schedule Service Improvements**
   - Added retry logic for API calls with exponential backoff
   - Implemented automatic token refresh before API calls
   - Added better error handling with user-friendly messages

## Implementation Notes

- The token manager starts automatically and checks token validity every 5 minutes
- Tokens are refreshed proactively when they are within 10 minutes of expiring
- Authentication state is synchronized across components via context
- Debug information is only shown in development mode

## How to Use

To leverage the new authentication improvements:

1. The token manager is automatically initialized by the AuthProvider
2. The AuthStatus component will handle automatic token refreshing
3. API services now attempt to refresh tokens before making authenticated requests
4. For debugging authentication issues in development, use the AuthDebug component

## Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing a more robust offline caching strategy
2. Add a global error boundary for handling authentication errors
3. Implement silent refresh in an iframe for better UX
4. Add analytics to track authentication failures for monitoring

# Deployment Fixes for Course Finder App

This document outlines the key changes made to address production issues in the Course Finder application.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Authentication Timeouts**: Fixed timeout issues when checking authentication status and refreshing sessions.
2. **API Route Failures**: Improved error handling and retry logic in API routes.
3. **Database Connection Issues**: Enhanced Prisma configuration for better handling of connection pooling in Vercel production environment.
4. **Vercel Configuration**: Updated function timeouts and memory allocation to prevent API errors.

## Changes Made

### Authentication Improvements

1. Added timeout handling to Supabase client operations:

   - Implemented `Promise.race()` pattern to prevent hanging on auth operations
   - Added retry logic with exponential backoff for auth operations
   - Improved error handling in auth flows

2. Enhanced the `useAuth` hook:
   - Added multiple attempts for auth checks
   - Implemented graceful degradation for auth operations
   - Improved session refresh reliability

### Database Connection Improvements

1. Updated Prisma configuration for Vercel:

   - Configured proper connection pooling settings
   - Added support for Vercel's serverless environment
   - Implemented timeout handling for database operations

2. Enhanced database operation reliability:
   - Added retries with exponential backoff for database operations
   - Improved error handling for connection issues
   - Added simple caching mechanism for frequently accessed data

### Vercel Configuration Optimization

1. Updated `vercel.json`:

   - Increased function timeouts from 10-30s to 30-60s
   - Increased memory allocation for key API routes
   - Added specific configuration for critical routes

2. Optimized Next.js configuration:
   - Added server optimization settings
   - Configured better handling of external packages
   - Added performance optimizations for production

### Added Diagnostic Tools

1. Added new health check endpoint:

   - `/api/health/connection` for diagnosing connection issues
   - Comprehensive checks for database and auth services

2. Enhanced existing diagnostic tools:
   - Improved auth diagnostics page
   - Added timeout handling to diagnostics
   - Better error reporting

## Testing in Production

After deploying these changes, verify that:

1. Authentication works reliably
2. The schedule page loads without errors
3. Course details and reviews load properly
4. The application is responsive and doesn't time out

If issues persist, use the diagnostic tools at `/diagnostics` to identify specific problems.

## Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing a more robust caching strategy
2. Monitor Vercel logs for any remaining timeout issues
3. Consider implementing a more sophisticated retry mechanism for critical operations
